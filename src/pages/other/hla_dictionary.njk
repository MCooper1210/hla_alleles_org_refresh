<div class="mb-3">
  The 2008 report of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) data dictionary presents serologic equivalents of HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DRB3, -DRB4, -DRB5, and -DQB1 alleles. The dictionary is an update of the one published in 2004. The data summarize equivalents obtained by the World Health Organization Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System, the International Cell Exchange, UCLA, the National Marrow Donor Program, recent publications, and individual laboratories. The 2008 edition includes information on 832 new alleles (685 class I and 147 class II) and updated information on 766 previously listed alleles (577 class I and 189 class II). The tables list the alleles with remarks on the serologic patterns and the equivalents. The serological equivalents are listed as expert assigned types, and the data are useful for identifying potential stem cell donors who were typed by either serology or DNA-based methods. The tables with HLA equivalents are available as a searchable form on the IMGT/HLA database Web site (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/dictionary.html).
