This repository contains the ongoing website redesign for [HLA.alleles.org](http://hla.alleles.org), a comprehensive resource for information on HLA and related genes. Eleventy is being used to build all of the pages, currently working on adding content to these pages now.

```bash
npm install @11ty/eleventy
